# User Management - Crowd Helper Features

*Problem: Crowd marks every input field as required on Add User form. Filling them by hand can be very time-consuming,
 and even totally unnecessary, for instance, when the user properties will be automatically synced from an external
 directory.*

ACHBrE will auto-generate password, autofill e-mail address, family name and given name inputs when typing in username.
