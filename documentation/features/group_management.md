# Group Management - Crowd Helper Features

## Group Operations on Multiple directories
*Problem: Crowd manages groups on a directory level. If the same set of groups is to be used in
 multiple directories, it is a very tedious and error-prone creating each group in each directory.*

Crowd Helpers allows to add or remove a given group in all directories with a single click.

## Add Multiple Groups After One Another

*Problem: Crowd navigates away from the Add Group form to the newly created group right away,
 preventing quick addition of multiple groups.*

ACHBrE prevents Crowd from navigating away from *Add Group* view, which allows adding multiple directories in rapid
succession.
